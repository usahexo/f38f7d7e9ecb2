#  How Much Blackjack Supplier Make Flaubert?

This ask yourself is tougher than it appears. If you were an excellent blackjack player, do you really think the supplier would make much money at all off of you? Probably not a lot. But if you are a bad player, the supplier could make a lot of money from you.

The reason for this is that blackjack is a game where the house has a statistical advantage. This means that over time, the supplier will make more money from bets that they take in than they will lose. This advantage varies depending on the rules of the game, but it is always in favour of the house.

For this reason, blackjack is often seen as a “suckers game”. This means that people who don’t know what they are doing can easily lose money playing it. However, for those that do know what they are doing, blackjack can be a very profitable game.

So how much can the supplier make from a typical blackjack player? It really depends on how good or bad that player is. A good player might only lose 10% of their bankroll to the supplier, while a bad player might lose 50% or more.
