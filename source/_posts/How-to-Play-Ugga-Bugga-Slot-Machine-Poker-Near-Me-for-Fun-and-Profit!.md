#  How to Play Ugga Bugga Slot Machine Poker Near Me for Fun and Profit!

Looking to have some fun and maybe make a little profit while you're at it? Look no further than the Ugga Bugga slot machine poker game! This exciting and easy-to-learn game can be played at casinos near you, or even online. Read on for some tips on how to play and hopefully come out ahead.

# Getting Started

The first thing you'll need to do is learn the basic rules of the game. Ugga Bugga is a variant of five-card draw poker, so if you know how to play that game, you'll be able to pick up the basics of Ugga Bugga pretty quickly. The basic idea is to draw cards until you have a hand that either beats the other players or ties them. The betting process is also pretty similar to regular poker; each player places their bet before any cards are laid down, and then subsequent bets are placed during the course of the hand.

# Playing the Game

Once everyone has placed their bets, the dealer will deal out five cards to each player (and one face-up card in the middle of the table). The player with the best hand at this point wins the pot. If there's a tie, then the pot gets split between all of the players that tied. In order to win, your hand must consist of one of the following:

A pair (two cards of equal rank) - e.g., two kings
3 of a kind (three cards of equal rank) - e.g., three queens
A straight (five consecutive cards of any suit) - e.g., Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5
A flush (five cards of same suit) - e.g., five hearts
A full house (three cards of one rank and two cards another rank) - e.g., three twos and two sixes
4 of a kind (four cards of same rank) - e.g., four jacks
A straight flush (five consecutive cards all of same suit) - e.g., Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5 all clubs 
A Royal Flush (ten through ace all clubs) 

If your hand doesn't fall into any of these categories, then it's considered a "high card" hand and you'll lose automatically unless you have better than everyone else at the table.
