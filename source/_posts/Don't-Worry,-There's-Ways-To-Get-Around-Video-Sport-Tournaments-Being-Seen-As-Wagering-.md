#  Don't Worry, There's Ways To Get Around Video Sport Tournaments Being Seen As Wagering 

In the United States, there’s a growing concern around how video game tournaments are being viewed by the government. Especially when it comes to competitive gaming being tied in with gambling. Lawmakers seem to think that children and young adults are taking part in these events more so to gamble than for the love of competition. So much so, that there’s been talk about making it illegal for anyone under 21 years of age to compete in them.

This would be a major hit to the esports industry as a whole. Not to mention the fans who love watching their favorite players compete. There’s definitely something alluring about betting on games, but that doesn’t mean that everyone is doing it. Nor does it mean that everyone who bets is doing it irresponsibly. People have been wagering on all sorts of competitions for centuries - from horse racing to football matches. There’s nothing inherently wrong with betting on video game tournaments either, providing people are doing so responsibly.

Just like any other pastime or entertainment option, there will always be those who take things too far and ruin it for everyone else. But outlawing an entire genre of competition because of the actions of a few irresponsible individuals is not the answer. There needs to be a way for people to bet on video game tournaments without them being seen as gambling and that’s where regulation comes in. If done correctly, regulation can help protect both consumers and the industry itself from abuse while still allowing people to bet on their favorite games in a responsible manner.

At the moment, there are very few regulations when it comes to esports betting. This leaves the door open for unscrupulous operators to take advantage of consumers. By implementing some basic rules and guidelines, regulators can help ensure that players are getting a fair deal and aren’t being scammed out of their hard-earned money. This would also help reduce the risk of match-fixing, as well as other nefarious activities that could damage the reputation of esports as a whole.

Regulators could also help ensure that underage gamers are not taking part in wagering activities. This would involve working with tournament organizers to come up with systems that can verify the ages of participants. This is something that is currently done in traditional sports, so there’s no reason why it can’t be implemented in esports as well.

So far, very few jurisdictions have taken any action when it comes to regulating esports betting. However, this is likely to change in the near future as more and more people start taking part in these events. It will be up to regulators around the world to decide whether they want video game tournaments to be seen as gambling or not - and whether or not they are willing to put in place the necessary measures needed to protect consumers and the industry alike

#  Clever Tips To Help Avoid Video Sport Tournaments Being Seen As Wagering 

Online video gaming tournaments are becoming ever more popular and there are some terrific means for avoiding them being seen as wagers. These tournaments could offer some genuine money rewards in addition to bragging rights, but if they’re not planned correctly they can easily come below scrutiny from betting regulators. 

The following suggestions will help you keep your video gaming tournament from being categorized as an illegal wager: 

1) Use competitors from the same geographic area. This will help avoid any potential gambling laws as it pertains to regional contests. 

2) Make sure the entry fee is a nominal amount. If the entry fee is too high, it could be construed as a wager. 

3) Restrict prizes to products or gift certificates instead of cash. Again, this will help avoid any gambling laws and make your tournament more appealing to players. 

4) Have all players compete against each other in every round. This will make it difficult to classify your tournament as a wager, as the outcome is determined by player skill and not chance. 

5) Keep your tournament duration short. This will also help make it less likely that your contest will be classified as a wager.
