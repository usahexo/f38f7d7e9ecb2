In an effort to better understand the problem, casinos are taking a closer look at how people become addicted to gambling in the first place. What they're finding may open more people's eyes to this often hidden addiction. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, between 2 and 3 percent of the adult population has a gambling problem. This percentage rises significantly when it comes to younger adults; up to 6 percent of 18-24 year olds are believed to have a gambling problem.

So why do some people become addicted while others don't? There isn't just one answer since gambling addiction can stem from different things for different people.

Still others may use gambling as a way to escape problems or feelings like anxiety or depression.

Whatever the reason, once someone becomes addicted to gambling it can be tough to break free. The cycle of hope and disappointment often leads to negative consequences like debt, job loss, and family problems. And yet, even knowing all this, some people still can't resist the temptation of casino games or online betting.
