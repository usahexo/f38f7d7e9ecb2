#  How to increase your chances of winning the SuperLotto!

Across the United States, there are numerous lottery games that players can partake in. The most popular of these is the SuperLotto. This game has a jackpot that starts at $2 million and continually grows until it is won. To date, the SuperLotto’s largest jackpot was $365 million—which was split by three winning tickets in 2007.

So, how do you increase your chances of winning the SuperLotto? Below are four tips to help you improve your odds.

1) Play regularly

One of the best ways to increase your chances of winning the SuperLotto is by playing regularly. This way, you’ll have more opportunities to win, and your odds will improve as well.

2) Choose your numbers wisely

Another way to improve your odds is by choosing your numbers wisely. If you have a specific set of numbers in mind, try to choose a combination that has not been picked before. Statistically speaking, this will give you a better chance of winning.

3) Buy tickets with a multiplier

If you want to increase your chances even further, consider buying tickets with a multiplier. This will exponentially increase your potential winnings if you happen to hit the jackpot.

4) Join a pool

If you don’t want to play individually, consider joining a pool with friends or family members. This will increase your chances of winning by allowing you to buy more tickets—and it can be more fun as well!
