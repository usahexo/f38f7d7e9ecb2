#  South African online gamblers face prosecution

Online gambling is illegal in South Africa, and while it is not being actively prosecuted, players could face jail time or a heavy fine if caught.

The law, introduced in 2008, makes it an offence to gamble online or to operate an online gambling site. It also prohibits South Africans from using offshore sites to gamble.

The National Gambling Board (NGB) recently warned that it would soon start prosecuting people who break the law.

“What we have been doing is gathering intelligence on who the key players are,” NGB spokesperson Sizakele Ntuli said.

“Now that we have that information, we are starting to prosecute. So people must be aware that this is not a joke; it is a criminal offence.”

She said the NGB was not interested in persecuting ordinary citizens who gamble small amounts of money, but was targeting big operators.

The Gambling Act does not define what constitutes “online gambling”, leaving it up to the authorities to decide what is and isn’t allowed. This has resulted in a grey area where some forms of gambling are tolerated while others are not.

For example, the National Lottery is legal in South Africa, while betting on sports or racing is not. Roulette and blackjack can be played in licensed casinos, while online versions of these games are illegal. Poker is technically legal, but there are no licensed poker rooms in South Africa.

Many people circumvent the law by using foreign-based sites which are not banned in South Africa. These sites often offer better odds and more games than local sites.

#  Online gambling still illegal in South Africa

Despite the fact that most other forms of gambling are legal in South Africa, online gambling is still illegal. This means that South Africans cannot legally gamble on the internet. There are a number of reasons for this, but one of the main reasons is that the South African government believes that online gambling can be addictive and lead to financial problems for many people.

This is not the only reason why online gambling is illegal in South Africa, however. Another reason is that the government believes that online gambling can be used for money laundering and other criminal activities. This is because it is much easier to hide your identity when you are gambling online, and it is much harder for the authorities to track down criminals who are using online casinos and sports betting websites to launder money.

Despite this, many people in South Africa still gamble online illegally. This is because there are a number of offshore websites that accept bets from South African players, and these websites are not regulated by the South African government. As a result, there is very little protection for players who lose money on these websites. In addition, there have been cases where players have been scammed by dishonest operators on these websites.

So far, the South African government has not taken any action against offshore websites that accept bets from South African players. However, it is possible that this could change in the future, especially if there are more cases of people being scammed or losing money on these websites. In the meantime, if you want to gamble online, you will have to do so illegally.

#  Government urged to legalise online gambling in South Africa

As the world around us evolves, it is becoming more and more apparent that the traditional methods of doing things are no longer viable. This is certainly true in the case of gambling, where online gambling is fast becoming the norm.

A recent study commissioned by the international market research firm, Ipsos, has found that a whopping 47% of South Africans have gambled online in the past 12 months. Of these, 67% did so on their mobile devices.

This is unsurprising when you consider that online gambling is not only more convenient but also offers better odds than traditional land-based casinos. It also allows players to bet on sports and games from anywhere in the world without having to leave the comfort of their own homes.

The problem, however, is that online gambling is currently illegal in South Africa. This means that players run the risk of being arrested and prosecuted if they choose to gamble online.

This outdated law needs to be repealed immediately and replaced with legislation that legitimises and regulates online gambling in South Africa. Doing so would not only benefit casino operators and consumers alike but could also contribute billions of rand to our struggling economy.

#  SA online gamblers could be hit with up to R10 million fines

The National Gambling Board has proposed fines of up to R10 million for online gambling offences, as part of its revised gambling policy.

In a notice published in the Government Gazette on Friday, the NGB said that the proposed fines were in line with its constitutional mandate to protect vulnerable people from the harmful effects of gambling.

"It is envisaged that these high fines will act as a deterrent and reduce occurrences of illegal gambling," the notice said.

Online gamblers could be hit with fines of up to R10 million if caught gambling illegally.

The National Gambling Board, who proposed these fines, said that they are in line with their constitutional mandate to protect vulnerable people from the harmful effects of gambling. They believe that by slapping heavy fines on offenders, it will act as a deterrence and reduce instances of unlawful gambling.

#  Legalising online gambling in SA could provide billions in revenue

A recent study conducted by EY has found that the legalisation of online gambling in South Africa could provide the government with billions of rand in revenue. The study found that, if regulated effectively, online gambling could bring in as much as R6.7 billion in tax revenue over a period of five years.

This is not the first time that the potential benefits of online gambling have been explored. A report released by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2017 estimated that, if properly regulated, the industry could be worth around R10 billion per year. This would represent a significant contribution to the Treasury’s coffers and would help to finance much-needed social and infrastructure programmes.

The implementation of online gambling legislation faces several challenges, however. One is the need to protect consumers from fraud and financial harm. Another is ensuring that the industry is properly regulated and policed so as to protect against criminal activity such as money laundering and terrorist financing.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that online gambling has considerable potential to benefit South Africa’s economy. If these challenges can be overcome, it is likely that we will see this form of entertainment becoming increasingly popular in our country in the years to come.
