#  Milwaukee Brewers Hope to Gamble on a Spot in the Playoffs

The Milwaukee Brewers have battled all season to stay in contention for the playoffs. With just a few games left in the season, they sit on the edge of a spot in the Wild Card game.

In order to make it into the playoffs, the Brewers will need to win their final regular season game, and hope that the St. Louis Cardinals lose. If both teams win, then the Cardinals will take the final playoff spot.

The Brewers have been led by Christian Yelich this season. Yelich is batting .315 with 36 home runs and 106 RBIs. He has also stolen 23 bases this season.

Brewers pitcher Jhoulys Chacin has also had a strong season. He is 14-8 with a 3.50 ERA.

If everything falls into place for the Brewers, they could make a run in the playoffs. However, they are certainly not a lock to make it in, and will need to win their last game to have any chance at all.

#  Milwaukee Brewers Pushing All Their Chips In for Playoff Run 

A few weeks ago, it looked like the Milwaukee Brewers were out of playoff contention. But with a red-hot streak in August, they have now taken over the second wild card spot in the National League.

Obviously, getting into the playoffs is still a long shot for the Brewers. They would need to pass at least one team in front of them and then hope that another team either collapses or loses in a tiebreaker game.

But that hasn't stopped the Brewers from trying. Recently, they made a big trade for Jonathan Schoop, who is currently on an 0-for-21 slump. Schoop is an all-or-nothing player - when he's going well, he can carry a team; but when he's not, he can be a liability.

The Brewers are betting that Schoop is currently in a downswing and will start hitting again soon. They're also betting that he will be motivated to play well in order to get a big contract next season.

It's definitely a risky move, but if it pays off, the Brewers could make a deep run into the playoffs.

#  Sport Betting: Milwaukee Brewers Taking a risky chance?

The Milwaukee Brewers had a big offseason, signing free agent Lorenzo Cain and trading for Christian Yelich. The team is hoping that the additions can help them take the next step and make the playoffs for the first time since 2011.

One of the risks that the Brewers took was trading top prospects Lewis Brinson and Monte Harrison to the Marlins for Yelich. Brinson is currently ranked as the number three prospect in all of baseball by Baseball America, and Harrison was ranked tenth. The Brewers clearly believe that Yelich can be a difference-maker and are hoping that he can lead them to a playoff berth.

So far this season, Yelich has been everything the Brewers were hoping for. He is hitting .319 with ten homers and 36 RBIs. He has also stolen seventeen bases, which is second on the team behind Cain.

Cain has also been great for Milwaukee this year. He is hitting .305 with eight homers and thirty-six RBIs. He has also stolen fifteen bases.

The Brewers have one of the most explosive offenses in baseball, as they are averaging 5.07 runs per game, which is fifth best in MLB. If they continue to play at this level, they should have no problem making the playoffs.

Their pitching staff has been up-and-down this year, but they have been getting strong performances from their starters recently. Chase Anderson, Jhoulys Chacin, and Zach Davies have all been pitching well lately, which should give the bullpen some relief.

The Brewers are currently in first place in the National League Central division with a record of 43-32. They are two games ahead of the Cubs for first place, so they certainly control their own destiny at this point.

If they can continue to play like they have been recently, there is no reason why they can’t make it to the playoffs for the first time in seven years.

#  Why the Milwaukee Brewers gamble Paid off

In February of 2018, the Milwaukee Brewers signed free agent Lorenzo Cain to a 5-year/$80 million contract. Cain was coming off an excellent 2017 season in which he batted .300 with 15 home runs, 26 stolen bases and an .816 OPS for the Kansas City Royals.

Brewers general manager David Stearns was criticized by some for overpaying Cain, given that he was already 30 years old and had never played in a postseason game. However, Stearns was confident that Cain could continue to produce at a high level and that his veteran presence would be valuable in helping the Brewers contend for a playoff spot.

Cain quickly proved the critics wrong, batting .305 with 8 homers, 26 RBIs and a .905 OPS in 83 games for the Brewers before being sidelined with a strained hamstring in late August. The Brewers went on to win the NL Central Division title, largely thanks to Cain’s contributions.

Despite playing just 111 games due to injuries, Cain still finished fifth in NL MVP voting. Had he been healthy all season, it’s likely that he would have been even more productive and could have helped lead the Brewers all the way to the World Series.

The gamble by the Brewers front office paid off big time in 2018 and they are now poised to be one of the top teams in baseball heading into 2019.
