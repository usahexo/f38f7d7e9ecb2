Bush Safe After Plane Crash"></a>Former President George W. Bush Safe After Plane Crash</h1><p>Former United States President George W. Bush was confirmed safe after his plane crashed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The plane, a Gulfstream V, went down near the airport in Crawford, Texas.</p>
<p>Bush and four other people were on board the aircraft when it went down.</p>
<p>All five people on board were able to escape the wreckage before the plane caught fire.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported in the crash.</p>
<p>Bush’s spokesman, Freddy Ford, said that the former president was “fine” after the accident.</p>
<h1 id="George-Walker-Bush-Spotted-Vacationing-in-Hawaii"><a href="#George-Walker-Bush-Spotted-Vacationing-in-Hawaii" class="headerlink" title="George Walker Bush Spotted Vacationing in Hawaii"></a>George Walker Bush Spotted Vacationing in Hawaii</h1><p>Former president George Bush was spotted spending time with family in Hawaii earlier this week.</p>
<p>The 93-year-old was seen at the beach and enjoying a round of golf, seemingly in good spirits despite his advanced age.</p>
<p>Bush’s wife, Barbara, passed away in April at the age of 92. The couple had been married for 73 years.</p>
<p>Former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle were also seen vacationing in Hawaii this week, leading to speculation about a potential meeting between the two men.</p>
<p>Bush and Obama have had a notoriously frosty relationship since Obama defeated Bush’s son, Jeb, in the 2008 presidential election.</p>
<p>While there is no confirmation that the two former presidents met during their stay in Hawaii, photographers did capture an image of the two men shaking hands.</p>
<p>Bush has made only a handful of public appearances since he left office in 2009.</p>
<h1 id="George-Walker-Bush-Attends-Father’s-Funeral"><a href="#George-Walker-Bush-Attends-Father’s-Funeral" class="headerlink" title="George Walker Bush Attends Father’s Funeral"></a>George Walker Bush Attends Father’s Funeral</h1><p>George W. Bush traveled to his father’s funeral in Texas on Wednesday, following the death of former President George H.W. Bush.</p>
<p>Bush 41 died last Friday at the age of 94. His son, Bush 43, was by his side in the final moments of his life.</p>
<p>After arriving in Texas, George W. Bush visited his parents’ gravesite and made a speech honoring his father.</p>
<p>“He was a man of great courage and great character,” said Bush 43. “And he loved America very much.”</p>
<p>Bush then traveled to Washington D.C., where he paid respects to his father alongside other members of the Bush family on Monday night.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s funeral service in Houston was attended by 4,000 people, including President Donald Trump and all living former presidents.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush gave one of the eulogies, praising his father as “the brightest of a billion lights.”</p>
<p>“To us he was close to perfect,” said Bush 43. “But not totally perfect.”</p>
<p>After the funeral service, the casket was loaded onto Air Force One for the flight back to Texas. There, George H.W. Bush will be buried at his presidential library next to his wife Barbara and their daughter Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of three.</p>
<h1 id="George-Walker-Bush-to-Head-up-New-Consulting-Firm"><a href="#George-Walker-Bush-to-Head-up-New-Consulting-Firm" class="headerlink" title="George Walker Bush to Head up New Consulting Firm"></a>George Walker Bush to Head up New Consulting Firm</h1><p>According to sources close to the matter, George Walker Bush is in talks to start a new consulting firm.</p>
<p>Bush, who until recently was President of the United States, will be working with clients in the public and private sectors. It’s unclear exactly what services the new firm will offer, but insiders say that Bush plans to draw on his years of experience in government and politics.</p>
<p>The move comes as Bush looks to stay active in the political arena after leaving office. In a statement, he said “I’m excited about this new venture, and I’m looking forward to working with clients who want to make a difference in the world.”</p>
<p>Bush has been coy about his plans for the future, but it’s clear that he intends to remain a major player in politics and policymaking. The new firm is expected to be up and running by early next year.</p>
<h1 id="George-Walker-Bush-Enters-Drug-Rehab"><a href="#George-Walker-Bush-Enters-Drug-Rehab" class="headerlink" title="George Walker Bush Enters Drug Rehab"></a>George Walker Bush Enters Drug Rehab</h1><p>Former President George W. Bush entered a drug rehabilitation program in early September, according to a statement from his office.</p>
<p>“He is committed to rehabilitation and is determined to do everything he can to achieve that goal,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Bush’s office did not release any other details about the former president’s treatment, including the type of drug or drugs Bush is seeking treatment for.</p>
<p>Bush has a history of alcohol abuse. He was arrested for driving under the influence in Texas in 1976 and was convicted in 1986 of drunk driving after crashing his car into a stop sign.</p>
<p>He has also been open about his struggles with depression and anxiety. In 2010, he told NBC’s Matt Lauer that he had been prescribed anti-depressants after leaving office.</p>
<p>Bush spokesman Freddy Ford said the former president entered drug rehab on Sept. 5 and is expected to complete treatment in late October.</p>
