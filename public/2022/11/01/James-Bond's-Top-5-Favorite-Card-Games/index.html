<h1 id="How-to-Play-Like-James-Bond-in-Casino-Royale"><a href="#How-to-Play-Like-James-Bond-in-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Like James Bond in Casino Royale"></a>How to Play Like James Bond in Casino Royale</h1><p>Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the twenty-first in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and the third to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, Casino Royale is set at the beginning of Bond’s career as Agent 007.</p>
<p>While in Montenegro, Bond pursues bomb maker Mollaka to a high-stakes poker game in order to thwart his terrorist plot. The film earned critical acclaim upon release. It became the highest-grossing instalment of the James Bond series until Skyfall surpassed it in November 2012.</p>
<p>So how do you live life like secret agent James Bond? Here are some tips from Casino Royale:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Get a cool car - If you want to feel like a secret agent then you need a cool car. In Casino Royale, James Bond drives an Aston Martin DB5 which is perfect for making a quick getaway if things go wrong. You don’t need an Aston Martin though – any sports car or luxury car will do. Just make sure it’s something that will turn heads when you drive it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn some self-defence – In order to survive in the world of espionage, you need to know how to defend yourself. In Casino Royale, James Bond is taught how to fight by none other than Sir Ian Fleming himself! If you don’t know how to fight then it might be worth taking some self-defence classes. That way you can protect yourself if things go wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be prepared for anything – As a secret agent, you never know what might happen next so you have to be prepared for anything. In Casino Royale, James Bond is prepared for anything from bombs going off to high-stakes poker games. Make sure you have an emergency kit with everything you might need in case of an emergency. You never know when you might need it!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be confident – one of the most important things for a secret agent is confidence. They need to be able to walk into any situation and take on whatever comes their way. This confidence comes across on screen and helps audiences believe that they could actually do what James Bond does. So work on your confidence and don’t be afraid to take on new challenges!</p>

<h1 id="Get-Lucky-Like-James-Bond-in-Casino-Royale"><a href="#Get-Lucky-Like-James-Bond-in-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Get Lucky Like James Bond in Casino Royale"></a>Get Lucky Like James Bond in Casino Royale</h1><p>Casino Royale is the 2006 film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film follows James Bond’s first mission as a 00 agent, earning his licence to kill.</p>
<p>The movie begins with Bond being briefed by M about a terrorist plot to destroy a Miami bridge. Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to observe the potential perpetrator, Le Chiffre. He then travels to Venice and plays poker against him in order to bankrupt him and force him to contact his financiers, with whom Bond plans to ambush and kill.</p>
<p>Bond wins the tournament, but Le Chiffre escapes with his money. Bond pursues him to an opera house in Madagascar, where he kills him.</p>
<p>The film was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Daniel Craig as James Bond, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, Judi Dench as M and Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter. It was produced by Eon Productions and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment.</p>
<p>Craig’s casting was initially met with some scepticism owing to his blonde hair and less traditionally “British” looks, but he ultimately proved himself well-suited for the role, winning widespread acclaim for his performance. The film earned just over $594 million at the global box office. On Rotten Tomatoes it holds a approval rating of 93% based on 282 reviews with an average rating of 8&#x2F;10. The site’s critical consensus reads: “Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers an intense, emotional performance as a rogue assassin.” Metacritic gives it a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 44 critic reviews indicating “universal acclaim”.</p>
<p>In 2007 Casino Royale was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture but won none. It also won two BAFTA Awards for Best Sound Design and Best Supporting Actor (Mikkelsen).</p>
