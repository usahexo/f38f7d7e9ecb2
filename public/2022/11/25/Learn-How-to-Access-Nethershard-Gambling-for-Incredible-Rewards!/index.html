This unique and exciting new feature can be accessed by players who have reached level 110 and completed the Artifact Knowledge campaign. By doing so, you’ll gain access to the Violet Hold dungeon located in Dalaran, where you can start your gambling journey.</p>
<p>Nethershard gambling is a fun and rewarding way to spend your time in World of Warcraft. In this guide, we’ll teach you all about it so that you can make the most of this unique feature.</p>
<p>What is Nethershard Gambling?</p>
<p>Nethershard gambling is a type of mini-game that allows players to gamble their hard-earned nethershards in exchange for random rewards. These rewards can include gold, experience, loot, and even other nethershards. The odds of receiving each type of reward are randomized, so it’s impossible to predict exactly what you’ll get from each round of gambling. However, this unpredictability is what makes the game so exciting!</p>
<p>How Do I Play?</p>
<p>To play Nethershard gambling, you first need to reach level 110 and complete the Artifact Knowledge campaign. Once you’ve done that, head over to the Violet Hold dungeon in Dalaran and speak with Lord Jorach Ravencrest to start playing. He can be found inside the second room on the left side as you enter the dungeon.</p>
<p>Once you’ve spoken with Lord Jorach Ravencrest, he’ll give you a gambing token which will allow you to participate in games of chance. You can then use this token to gamble with Lord Jorach or one of his assistants. Each assistant has a different set of rewards available, so be sure to gamble with all three of them to get the widest range of possible rewards!</p>
<p>What Are the Risks?</p>
<p>As with any type of gambling, there are risks involved in playing Nethershard gambling. If you lose your gambing token, for example, you won’t be able to play until you get another one from Lord Jorach Ravencrest. Additionally, there is no guarantee that you’ll receive any rewards at all from playing Nethershard gambling. The only thing you can be sure of is that it’s an exciting and unpredictable way to spend your time in World of Warcraft!</p>
