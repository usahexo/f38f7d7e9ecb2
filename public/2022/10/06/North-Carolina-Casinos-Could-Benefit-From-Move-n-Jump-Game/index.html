        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="North-Carolina-Casinos-Could-Benefit-From-Move-n-Jump-Game"><a href="#North-Carolina-Casinos-Could-Benefit-From-Move-n-Jump-Game" class="headerlink" title="North Carolina Casinos Could Benefit From Move n Jump Game"></a>North Carolina Casinos Could Benefit From Move n Jump Game</h1><p>North Carolina casinos are looking for new ways to bring in customers, and the move n jump game could be the solution. This game is a new take on classic casino games, and it has been a big hit in other states.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the game is simple. You move your character around the screen by jumping, and you try to collect as many coins as possible. The coins can then be used to buy power-ups and bonuses.</p>
<p>There are three different modes in the game, and each one offers a unique challenge. The first mode is called Quest Mode, and it requires you to complete a series of tasks. The second mode is called Survival Mode, and it challenges you to survive for as long as possible. The third mode is called Challenge Mode, and it is a race against the clock.</p>
<p>The move n jump game is available for free on Android and iOS devices, so there is no excuse not to try it out.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Proponents-Claim-North-Carolina-Could-Benefit-From-Move-n-Jump-Game"><a href="#Casino-Proponents-Claim-North-Carolina-Could-Benefit-From-Move-n-Jump-Game" class="headerlink" title="Casino Proponents Claim North Carolina Could Benefit From Move n Jump Game"></a>Casino Proponents Claim North Carolina Could Benefit From Move n Jump Game</h1><p>A representative of the Casino Association of North Carolina testified Wednesday that a proposed constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling in the state would be a boon to businesses and generate millions of dollars for public education.<br>The amendment’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Stam, countered that the money generated by legalized gambling would mostly go to “greedy casino owners” and cited concerns about problem gambling.</p>
<p>Supporters of the amendment argue that legalizing casinos would bring in new revenue and jobs to a state that has been struggling economically. They say it would also help fund education, which is facing cuts under the current budget.</p>
<p>Detractors of the amendment argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also maintain that most of the tax revenue generated by casinos would go to developers and casino operators rather than to schools or other government programs.</p>
<h1 id="North-Carolina-Casinos-Vie-for-New-Slots-License"><a href="#North-Carolina-Casinos-Vie-for-New-Slots-License" class="headerlink" title="North Carolina Casinos Vie for New Slots License"></a>North Carolina Casinos Vie for New Slots License</h1><p>With the North Carolina General Assembly’s repeal of the state’s long-standing ban on casino gambling, the race is on among the state’s cities and counties to lure one of two new licenses for casino gambling.</p>
<p>While some municipalities are already moving forward with plans to build a casino, others are holding out for a better deal. Charlotte and Greensboro are both vying for the license, with each city proposing a massive development that would include a hotel, restaurants, and of course, gaming tables and slot machines.</p>
<p>Raleigh is also hoping to get in on the action, with Mayor Nancy McFarlane announcing her support for a casino project that would create thousands of jobs. McFarlane said that Raleigh is well-positioned to win one of the licenses because it has all the necessary infrastructure in place, including an airport and major highways.</p>
<p>Gambling supporters say that casino gambling will bring much-needed revenue to the state, which has been struggling to fund its education system and other important programs. But opponents argue that casinos will lead to increased crime and addiction rates.</p>
<h1 id="With-Casino-Expansion-in-the-Works-North-Carolina-Looks-to-Jump-Into-the-Gaming-World"><a href="#With-Casino-Expansion-in-the-Works-North-Carolina-Looks-to-Jump-Into-the-Gaming-World" class="headerlink" title="With Casino Expansion in the Works, North Carolina Looks to Jump Into the Gaming World"></a>With Casino Expansion in the Works, North Carolina Looks to Jump Into the Gaming World</h1><p>Earlier this year, the North Carolina state Senate passed a bill that would legalize casinos in the state. The measure now awaits approval from the House of Representatives and from Governor Roy Cooper. If all goes as planned, the first casino could be open by 2020.</p>
<p> While some legislators are opposed to the measure, citing concerns about gambling addiction and its impact on communities, most believe that casino gambling will bring jobs and economic development to North Carolina.</p>
<p> Proponents of casino gambling argue that it is a relatively safe form of entertainment that can generate significant revenue for states and localities. And given the competition among states to attract new businesses, it’s not surprising that North Carolina is considering legalizing casinos.</p>
<p> There are currently thirty-eight states with legalized casino gambling, including Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Texas. </p>
<p> Gambling revenues have been declining in recent years as consumers have shifted their spending to other forms of entertainment such as online gaming and eSports. In order to compete in the gaming industry and keep up with advances in technology, many states have turned to legalizing new forms of gambling such as online poker and sports betting. </p>
<p> North Carolina lawmakers estimate that casino legalization could generate as much as $1 billion in annual revenue. This would be a significant boost to the state’s economy and could create thousands of jobs. Casinos could also generate tax revenue for local governments and schools. </p>
<p> The supporters of casino gambling in North Carolina say that it is time for the state to join the rest of the country in this growing industry. They believe that it will bring jobs and economic development to parts of the state that need it most. Opponents argue that casinos can be harmful to communities and lead to addiction problems; but so far there has been little evidence to support these claims</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machines-Could-be-Coming-to-a-Casino-Near-You-in-North-Carolina"><a href="#Slot-Machines-Could-be-Coming-to-a-Casino-Near-You-in-North-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machines Could be Coming to a Casino Near You in North Carolina"></a>Slot Machines Could be Coming to a Casino Near You in North Carolina</h1><p>Casinos in North Carolina could be getting a new attraction to pull in players – slot machines.</p>
<p>The North Carolina General Assembly is considering a bill that would allow video lottery terminals (VLTs) in the state’s casinos. These terminals are essentially slot machines, and they would be a new addition to the casinos in North Carolina, which currently only offer games like blackjack, roulette, and craps.</p>
<p>If the bill is passed, it would mark a big change for the casino industry in North Carolina. The state has been without VLTs since 1989, when they were banned. Supporters of the bill say that the addition of VLTs would help the state’s casinos compete with those in other states, where gambling is more widespread.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that adding VLTs would lead to more gambling addiction and other problems. They also worry that the terminals would cannibalize revenue from other casino games.</p>
<p>The fate of the bill is still uncertain, but if it does pass, it will likely take effect later this year.</p>
