      		<h1 id="Dealer-creates-5-million-at-casino-poker-game"><a href="#Dealer-creates-5-million-at-casino-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Dealer creates $5 million at casino poker game"></a>Dealer creates $5 million at casino poker game</h1><p>A Las Vegas gambler who goes by the name of “The Hawk” has created a new poker record after winning nearly $5 million in a single game.</p>
<p>The Hawk, who is a well-known figure in the casino and poker circles, played at the Aria Resort and Casino last weekend and walked away with the huge win. The previous record was set by another high-roller known as “The Whale,” who won $4.8 million from a different casino back in 2011.</p>
<p>As is usually the case with these types of games, the Hawk’s opponents were all high-rolling professionals who were happy to take on someone with such deep pockets. In the end, it was The Hawk who came out on top and increased his impressive poker record even further.</p>
<p>While it’s unclear exactly how much money The Hawk has won over his career playing poker, it’s safe to say that he is now one of the biggest winners in history. His latest victory is sure to add to his reputation as one of the most feared players in town.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-creates-10-million-at-casino-poker-game"><a href="#Dealer-creates-10-million-at-casino-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Dealer creates $10 million at casino poker game"></a>Dealer creates $10 million at casino poker game</h1><p>At a casino in Las Vegas, a professional poker dealer going by the name of “Jason” created $10 million in just a few hours playing high stakes poker with some of the wealthiest individuals in the city.</p>
<p>The exact details of how Jason was able to achieve this are unknown, but it is rumoured that he had a very successful day at the tables. Some eyewitnesses claim that Jason was even up by as much as $15 million at one point, before eventually losing some of his chips and finishing with $10 million in profits.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Jason refused to speak to the press. However, his employer - the casino where the game took place - issued a statement saying that they were “very proud” of their employee and that they looked forward to seeing more great results from him in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-creates-15-million-at-casino-poker-game"><a href="#Dealer-creates-15-million-at-casino-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Dealer creates $15 million at casino poker game"></a>Dealer creates $15 million at casino poker game</h1><p>Las Vegas – On Saturday night, 28-year old poker dealer Stanislaus Jacquet became a millionaire after he created a $15 million pot at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. Jacquet, who has been dealing at the casino for the past two years, was extremely lucky at the game table on Saturday night, taking home over $7.5 million himself.</p>
<p>The big win for Jacquet began when he raised the stakes to $3,000 on a hand of Texas Hold ‘Em, forcing his opponents to fold. Then, on the very next hand, Jacquet again raised the stakes to $6,000, this time forcing one of his opponents to fold. The only player left at the table was another dealer named Ryan D’Angelo.</p>
<p>At this point in the game both dealers had about the same amount of money in front of them and D’Angelo decided to call Jacquet’s bluff. The cards were dealt and it turned out that Jacquet had a royal flush, giving him the winning hand and earning him over $15 million in one shot.</p>
<p>When asked what he planned to do with his newfound wealth, Jacquet said that he was going to take it easy for a while and enjoy his new-found fortune. He also said that he planned on donating some money to charity and helping out friends and family members who were in need.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-creates-20-million-at-casino-poker-game"><a href="#Dealer-creates-20-million-at-casino-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Dealer creates $20 million at casino poker game"></a>Dealer creates $20 million at casino poker game</h1><p>Denver, CO - A dealer working at a downtown casino made headlines this week after creating a $20 million pot at a poker game.</p>
<p>The dealer, who has not been identified, was working at a nine-player table when the massive pot developed. The hand began with two players each putting in $1,000, and quickly escalated from there. By the time the hand was over, the pot had grown to more than $20 million.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that the dealer did not benefit from the massive pot, as all of the money went to the other players at the table. They also note that the dealer was playing with his or her own money, and had no advantage over any of the other players.</p>
<p>“This is an amazing feat,” said one casino spokesperson. “It’s rare to see a pot grow that large at a poker game.”</p>
<p>The lucky players who took down the massive pot are still unknown, as they have chosen to remain anonymous.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-creates-over-25-million-at-casino-poker-game"><a href="#Dealer-creates-over-25-million-at-casino-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Dealer creates over $25 million at casino poker game"></a>Dealer creates over $25 million at casino poker game</h1><p>42-year old casino poker dealer, Calvin A., created a commotion at the Fitz Casino &amp; Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi last week. He walked away from the table with more than $25 million in winnings.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Calvin has made a major score playing poker. In fact, he has been dealing at the casino for over 10 years and has won several large pots. But this latest windfall is by far his biggest to date.</p>
<p>Calvin says that he was “feeling lucky” on the night of his big win and just kept betting bigger and bigger as the game progressed. Eventually, all of his opponents folded, leaving him heads-up against the dealer. At this point, he had more than $15 million in chips!</p>
<p>The dealer then went all-in with his last $100,000, and Calvin called with pocket kings. His opponent showed two pair, but a five on the river gave Calvin the winning hand and sent the other player home with nothing.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they have never seen anything like it before and are still trying to come to terms with what happened. They are also busy trying to come up with a way to reward Calvin for his amazing accomplishment.</p>
