They were not given much of a chance by the sportsbooks to make it to the postseason. But they have hit the ground running and taken an early lead in the betting odds.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons for their success has been their starting pitching. Gerrit Cole has been absolutely dominant so far this season, and he is backed up by a strong rotation. The bullpen has also been solid, led by Mark Melancon.</p>
<p>The offense has also been impressive, thanks in part to breakout seasons from Starling Marte and Gregory Polanco. Andrew McCutchen continues to be one of the most dangerous hitters in baseball, and he gives the Pirates a chance to win any game.</p>
<p>This team is clearly for real, and they should not be underestimated by anyone. If they can continue to play well, there is no reason why they cannot make it to the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Pittsburgh-Pirates-prove-that-they-are-a-well-rounded-team-by-succeeding-in-multiple-sports-books"><a href="#Pittsburgh-Pirates-prove-that-they-are-a-well-rounded-team-by-succeeding-in-multiple-sports-books" class="headerlink" title="Pittsburgh Pirates prove that they are a well-rounded team by succeeding in multiple sports books"></a>Pittsburgh Pirates prove that they are a well-rounded team by succeeding in multiple sports books</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates have always been a successful team, but this year they have really proven themselves in multiple sports books. First and foremost, the Pirates are one of the top teams in baseball. They currently have the best record in the National League and the third-best record in all of baseball.</p>
<p>However, the Pirates are not just a one-dimensional team. They are also proving themselves to be a dominant team in other sports books. The Steelers, Penguins and Panthers all have winning records this year, and the Pirates are responsible for a good portion of that success.</p>
<p>The Steelers recently lost starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for the season due to an injury. However, backup quarterback Landry Jones has stepped up and led the Steelers to two consecutive victories. The first win was against division rival Cincinnati Bengals, and the second was against the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>The Penguins are having another great season this year. They are currently in first place in their division with a record of 22-10-5. The Panthers are also having a great year with a current record of 16-8-2.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pittsburgh Pirates are a well-rounded team that is succeeding in multiple sports books. This is thanks to their excellent players and coaching staffs across all teams. The Pirates will definitely be a team to watch as the playoffs approach!</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-flock-to-multiple-sports-books-in-order-to-get-their-bets-in-on-the-hot-Pirates-team"><a href="#Bettors-flock-to-multiple-sports-books-in-order-to-get-their-bets-in-on-the-hot-Pirates-team" class="headerlink" title="Bettors flock to multiple sports books in order to get their bets in on the hot Pirates team"></a>Bettors flock to multiple sports books in order to get their bets in on the hot Pirates team</h1><p>Pittsburgh, PA - Bettors from all around the tri-state area are flocking to sports books in order to place bets on the red hot Pittsburgh Pirates. The team has not lost a game in their past six outings and the oddsmakers have taken note, making them a +120 underdog against the St. Louis Cardinals this weekend.</p>
<p>Joey Votto and the Cincinnati Reds provide the next test for the Buccos this week, as they come into town for a four-game set starting on Monday night. The Reds have had their own share of struggles as of late and are just 4-4 in their last eight games. Pittsburgh is currently sitting in second place in the NL Central, 3.5 games behind the Brewers.</p>
<p>The Cardinals enter play on Friday with a 43-21 record, which is good for first place in the NL Central. They have been one of the best teams in baseball this season and will be a tough matchup for the Pirates, who are looking to make a run at their first playoff berth since 2014.</p>

<h1 id="Oddsmakers-struggle-to-keep-up-with-the-fast-paced-Pirates-who-continue-to-win-and-draw-attention-from-bettors"><a href="#Oddsmakers-struggle-to-keep-up-with-the-fast-paced-Pirates-who-continue-to-win-and-draw-attention-from-bettors" class="headerlink" title="Oddsmakers struggle to keep up with the fast-paced Pirates, who continue to win and draw attention from bettors"></a>Oddsmakers struggle to keep up with the fast-paced Pirates, who continue to win and draw attention from bettors</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates entered the 2017 season with a lot of hype. Many experts predicted that they would at least make it to the playoffs. And while they haven’t quite fulfilled those lofty expectations just yet, they are still in a good position to make a run in the second half of the season.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the Pirates’ success this year has been their ability to win games in a hurry. They have scored first in 22 of their 45 wins this season, and have come from behind to win six times. This quick-strike offense has kept the oddsmakers on their toes, as they struggle to set lines that properly reflect the Pirates’ true odds of winning.</p>
<p>This was evident on June 21st when the Pirates hosted division rivals, the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers were listed as 5.5-point favorites before the game started, but Pittsburgh jumped out to an early lead and ended up winning by a score of 11-3. Bettors who took the Pirates on the moneyline cashed in on their bet, as they only needed to risk $100 to win $360.</p>
<p>While some may see this as a fluke occurrence, the Pirates have actually been one of the league’s most dominant teams when it comes to scoring first. They are 17-5 when doing so and have outscored their opponents 74-35 in those games. In fact, Pittsburgh’s only two losses when leading after seven innings came against the Chicago Cubs - who are currently considered by many to be the best team in baseball.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to place a bet on the Pittsburgh Pirates, you can find great odds at [website name]. They offer betting lines on all of their games, and you can get paid out quickly and easily if you happen to win your bet. So don’t wait any longer - head over to [website name] today and start betting on America’s team!</p>

Not only did the team make some big free agent acquisitions in the offseason, but they have also looked dominant in their early games, proving themselves as one of the top teams in baseball.</p>
<p>The Pirates opened up their season with a three-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers. In that series, they outscored Detroit 18-6 and looked like a team that is ready to compete for a championship.</p>
<p>Some of the key players for Pittsburgh this season include outfielders Starling Marte and Gregory Polanco, as well as first baseman Josh Bell. All three players are off to strong starts this season and should continue to lead the team offensively.</p>
<p>The Pirates also have a strong pitching staff, led by ace Gerrit Cole. He is coming off a Cy Young Award-worthy season and is looking to take his game to another level in 2018. If he can do that, Pittsburgh will be tough to beat.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pirates appear to be a complete team and should be one of the favorites to win the World Series this year. If you are looking to place some bets on baseball, make sure to put your money on Pittsburgh. You won’t regret it!</p>
