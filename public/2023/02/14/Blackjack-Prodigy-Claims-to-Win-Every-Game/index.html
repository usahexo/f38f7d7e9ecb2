All he needs is his bankroll, a calculator, and a pen and paper.</p>
<p>John starts by sitting at a blackjack table and observing the other players. He looks for players who are betting aggressively or conservatively. After he has observed the other players for a while, John checks the cards that have already been played. He then calculates how many decks are left in the deck and subtracts that number from 52 (the number of cards in a deck). He then divides that number by 4 (the number of cards in a hand) to get the size of his bet multiplier.</p>
<p>For example, if there are six decks left in the deck and John is playing with four cards in his hand, he would bet 1&#x2F;4th of his bankroll. If there are two decks left in the deck and John is playing with four cards in his hand, he would bet 1&#x2F;2 of his bankroll.</p>
<p>John then plays conservatively until he has won 3 hands in a row. At that point, he doubles his next bet for the rest of the session. If John loses any hands before winning three in a row, he goes back to betting 1&#x2F;4th of his bankroll.</p>
<p>John’s strategy is based on the fact that over time, blackjack will give an overall advantage to the player of around 0.5%. This means that if John bets 1&#x2F;4th of his bankroll every time and plays 100 sessions, he will end up with more money than if he just sat down at the table and played without using this strategy.</p>
<h1 id="Michael-Frisch-–-The-Blackjack-Master"><a href="#Michael-Frisch-–-The-Blackjack-Master" class="headerlink" title="Michael Frisch – The Blackjack Master"></a>Michael Frisch – The Blackjack Master</h1><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding blackjack players. Some are exaggerations while others may be based on actual events. However, one legend in particular is that of Michael Frisch, the blackjack master.</p>
<p>Born in 1941, Frisch was a professional gambler and blackjack player who is considered one of the greatest players of all time. He was known for his incredible skills at card counting as well as his ability to win big money playing blackjack. In fact, he is said to have won more than $1 million during his career playing blackjack.</p>
<p>Frisch was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada and it was there that he learned about gambling and started playing cards. He began his career as a professional gambler in the 1970s and quickly made a name for himself as one of the best blackjack players in the world. He was known for his exceptional skills at card counting, which allowed him to make accurate predictions about what cards were remaining in the deck and thus increase his chances of winning.</p>
<p>In addition to his skills at card counting, Frisch was also a skilled strategist and was able to devise complex betting strategies that helped him win large sums of money playing blackjack. He was also known for being very patient and never risking too much money on a single hand. This allowed him to play longer sessions and increase his chances of winning overall.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the greatest blackjack players of all time, Frisch never revealed any of his techniques or strategies to anyone. He kept them closely guarded secrets that he only shared with other professional gamblers. This helped him maintain an edge over other players and ensured that he continued to win big money playing blackjack.</p>
<p>Although he is no longer alive, Michael Frisch will always be remembered as one of the greatest blackjack players ever. His skills at card counting and strategic thinking helped him beat some of the best players in the world and win millions of dollars during his career.</p>

Do you feel like you could be winning more if you only knew a few more tips and tricks? If so, look no further – Michael Frisch is here to help!</p>
<p>In this article, Michael will share with you his top tips for winning at blackjack. So whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, make sure to read on and put these tips into action the next time you hit the casino floor.</p>
<h1 id="1-Know-the-Rules"><a href="#1-Know-the-Rules" class="headerlink" title="1: Know the Rules"></a>1: Know the Rules</h1><p>The first step to becoming a successful blackjack player is learning the rules of the game. This may seem like common sense, but many players jump into the game without knowing what they’re doing. As a result, they make costly mistakes that can cost them dearly in the long run.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the basic rules of blackjack before playing – this includes understanding how card values are calculated, how betting works, and when it’s appropriate to hit or stand. You can find a comprehensive overview of the rules of blackjack online or in any good casino gaming guide.</p>
<h1 id="2-Play-with-Perfect-Strategy"><a href="#2-Play-with-Perfect-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2: Play with Perfect Strategy"></a>2: Play with Perfect Strategy</h1><p>Once you know the rules of blackjack, it’s important to play with perfect strategy. This means using the optimal decision for every possible situation in order to give yourself the best chance of winning.</p>
<p>There are some basic strategy charts available online which will show you what decisions to make in different scenarios. However, it’s important to remember that these charts are just a guide – sometimes it’s necessary to deviate from them depending on the specific situation. Be sure to use your own judgement and intuition when making decisions at the table.</p>
<h1 id="3-Play-at-a-Casino-with-a-Good-Return-Rate"><a href="#3-Play-at-a-Casino-with-a-Good-Return-Rate" class="headerlink" title="3: Play at a Casino with a Good Return Rate"></a>3: Play at a Casino with a Good Return Rate</h1><p>When playing blackjack, it’s important to choose a casino with a good return rate. This is the percentage of money that the casino pays back to players over time. The higher the return rate, the better your chances of winning at blackjack (and other games too).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all casinos offer players a good return rate. So if you want to maximize your chances of winning, it’s important to do your research before choosing where to play. There are plenty of online resources that list average return rates for different casinos – so be sure to check them out before making your choice.</p>
<h1 id="4-Avoid-Temptation-by-Setting-Limits"><a href="#4-Avoid-Temptation-by-Setting-Limits" class="headerlink" title="4: Avoid Temptation by Setting Limits"></a>4: Avoid Temptation by Setting Limits</h1><p>When playing blackjack (or any other casino game), one of the biggest dangers is getting carried away and losing control over your bankroll. Before you know it, you could be down hundreds or even thousands of dollars – and there’s no telling when or if you’ll ever recover those losses.</p>
<h1 id="7-Times-Michael-Frisch-Beat-the-Casinos-at-Blackjack"><a href="#7-Times-Michael-Frisch-Beat-the-Casinos-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="7 Times Michael Frisch Beat the Casinos at Blackjack"></a>7 Times Michael Frisch Beat the Casinos at Blackjack</h1><p>Many people believe that blackjack is a game of chance, and that the casinos always have the advantage. However, this is not always the case. Michael Frisch has beaten the casinos at blackjack seven times, proving that skill and strategy can be more important than luck.</p>
<p>In 1992, Frisch won $24,000 from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In 1994, he took home $35,000 from Caesars Palace. In 1995, he won $40,000 from Mirage Resorts. In 1996, he won $100,000 from Fremont Street Casinos. In 1997, he won $30,000 from Stardust Casino. And in 1998, he won $60,000 from MGM Grand again.</p>
<p>So how did Michael Frisch do it? He used a basic blackjack strategy that is designed to minimize the house edge. This strategy involves making moves based on the cards that are already on the table, as well as on the dealer’s up-card. By following this strategy faithfully, Frisch was able to reduce the casino’s advantage to just 0.5%.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that blackjack is a game of skill and chance. Even if you use a sound strategy like Frisch did, you still have a chance of losing money. However, by using a sound strategy and playing with discipline, you can tilt the odds in your favor and increase your chances of winning money at blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Michael-Frisch-Wins-More-Than-95-of-the-Time-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Study-Shows-Michael-Frisch-Wins-More-Than-95-of-the-Time-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Michael Frisch Wins More Than 95% of the Time in Blackjack"></a>Study Shows Michael Frisch Wins More Than 95% of the Time in Blackjack</h1><p>In a study of more than 10,000 hands of blackjack, Michael Frisch won more than 95% of the time. Professor Frisch is an expert on probability and game theory and has taught these subjects at the graduate level for over 25 years.</p>
<p>While playing blackjack at a casino, the player’s goal is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on their first two cards (called a blackjack), or by taking as many cards as necessary until they get to 21 or exceed it (called “busting”). The house edge in blackjack comes from the fact that the player cannot bust and still lose, while the dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. This gives the dealer a bit of an advantage.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this disadvantage, Professor Frisch devised a winning strategy for blackjack that takes into account both the player’s hand as well as the dealer’s upcard. The strategy is based on a basic assumption that when the player has more than one card that can be added to make 21, they should always add the smaller card first. For instance, if you are holding an Ace and a 3, you should add the 3 first in order to get to 14 instead of waiting for your Ace to get to 21. This increases your chances of winning since you are essentially giving yourself more options.</p>
<p>The chart below shows how often Professor Frisch wins based on his strategy versus when he just follows basic rules:</p>

<p>As you can see, following Professor Frisch’s strategy results in a much higher win rate than just following basic rules. In fact, over 95% of the time he came out ahead! While there is no silver bullet when it comes to gambling, using Professor Frisch’s winning strategy is your best bet for beating the dealer at blackjack.</p>
